    "A": "DNA is packed together with histone proteins in cell nuclei to form a compact structure called chromatin. Chromatin represents a scaffold for many genetic events and shows varying degrees of condensation, including a relatively open form (euchromatin) and a highly condensed form (heterochromatin). Enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and methylases covalently label the amino‐termini of histones, thereby creating a ‘histone code’ of modifications that is interpreted by the recruitment of other proteins through recognition domains. Ultimately, this network of interacting proteins is thought to control the degree of chromatin condensation so that DNA is available when it is required for genomic processes. Reviewed here are the structures of HAT and SET domains, which mediate the acetylation and methylation of histones, respectively, and bromodomains and chromodomains, which recognize the modified histones. How these structures have increased our understanding of DNA regulation is also discussed..",
    "B": "Statistical methods are important aids to detect trends, explore relationships and draw conclusions from experimental data. However, it is not uncommon to find that many researchers apply statistical tests without first checking whether they are appropriate for the intended application. The aim of this paper is to present some of the more important univariate and bivariate parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques and to highlight their uses based on practical examples in Food Science and Technology. The underlying requirements for use of particular statistical tests, together with their advantages and disadvantages in practical applications are also discussed, such as the need to check for normality and homogeneity of variances prior to the comparison of two or more sample sets in inference tests, correlation and regression analysis",
    "C": "America's critical infrastructure is becoming “smarter”and increasingly dependent on highly specialized computers called industrial control systems (ICS). Networked ICS components now called the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are at the heart of the “smart city”, controlling critical infrastructure, such as CCTV security networks, electric grids, water networks, and transportation systems. Without the continuous, reliable functioning of these assets, economic and social disruption will ensue. Unfortunately, IIoT are hackable and difficult to secure from cyberattacks. This leaves our future smart cities in a state of perpetual uncertainty and the risk that the stability of our lives will be upended. The Local government has largely been absent from conversations about cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, despite its importance. One reason for this is public administrators do not have a good way of knowing which assets and which components of those assets are at the greatest risk. This is further complicated by the highly technical nature of the tools and techniques required to assess these risks. Using artificial intelligence planning techniques, an automated tool can be developed to evaluate the cyber risks to critical infrastructure. It can be used to automatically identify the adversarial strategies (attack trees) that can compromise these systems. This tool can enable both security novices and specialists to identify attack pathways. We propose and provide an example of an automated attack generation method that can produce detailed, scalable, and consistent attack trees-the first step in securing critical infrastructure from cyberattack"

    "A major target for chromatin structure regulation is the nucleosome, which comprises a core of two copies of each of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, with 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the core (Luger et al, 1997; Fig 1A). The positioning of nucleosomes in chromatin is a reversible adenosine triphosphate (ATP)‐dependent process. Chromatin can therefore be considered as a variably compact, dynamic and yet stable construction.Histones are conserved from yeast to man and regulate many cellular events, including transcription, DNA replication, recombination and repair. Histones primarily act either by promoting DNA packaging into repressive heterochromatin in which DNA is largely inaccessible, or by relaxing chromatin into the less compact euchromatin. Variations in the generally repressive euchromatin structure aid bioprocesses by enhancing the accessibility of the DNA. The various ways that such changes occur have been reviewed recently (Felsenfeld & Groudine, 2003) and include ATP‐dependent chromatin remodelling, the incorporation of histone variants and covalent modifications to the histones, which were first described more than 30 years ago (Allfrey et al, 1964). The most studied covalent modifications are the acetylation and deacetylation of histone lysine residues, which usually correlate with transcriptional activation and repression, respectively (Eberharter & Becker, 2002). A simplistic model for activation is that acetylation cancels positive charges on histone lysine side chains, which facilitates the release of DNA to enhance its accessibility to transcription factors. By contrast, histone deacetylation reverses this effect, rendering DNA less available. In addition to acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation also occur in the histone amino (N)‐termini, and the interplay of modifications directs a host of genetic responses, as given in ‘the histone code’ (Strahl & Allis, 2000; Fig 1). A framework for understanding the basis of signalling by several simultaneous histone modifications was recently proposed, in which neighbouring modifications act together as ‘binary switches’. Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that numerous residues in linear strings of densely clustered modifiable sites might form ‘modification cassettes’ to create a large array of readouts through many local permutations (Fischle et al, 2003a). Chromatin can also be regulated by larger‐scale covalent attachments, including ubiquitylation and sumoylation. Histone ubiquitylation is implicated in transcriptional regulation by priming other histone modifications; for example, the ubiquitylation of yeast H2B Lys 123 is required before the methylation of H3, resulting in a trans‐histone regulatory mechanism that induces telomeric gene silencing (Zhang, 2003). Although histone ubiquitylation has long been known, the Bre1 RING domain has only recently been identified as the ubiquitin ligase for H2B (Hwang et al, 2003; Wood et al, 2003), and a ligase for H2A remains elusive. The conjugation of the small ubiquitin‐related modifier (SUMO) to H4 has also been observed and ascribed a role in transcriptional repression (Shiio & Eisenman, 2003). Because the structural understanding of histone ubiquitylation and sumoylation is relatively poor, this area is not discussed further. Rather, to illustrate the molecular basis of chromatin regulation by histone modifications, this review focuses first on histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domains that mediate histone acetylation and bromodomains that recognize the acetylated histones; and second on the recently emerging SET domains that mediate histone methylation and chromodomains that recognize the methylated histones. Although some aspects of this topic have been reviewed previously (Jenuwein & Allis, 2001; Marmorstein, 2001a), the wealth of recent structures has prompted a reappraisal of this growing field..",
    "Statistics is essentially a branch of mathematics applied to analysis of data. In Food Science, statistical procedures are required in the planning, analysis and interpretation of experimental work. Such work may include surveys of the chemical, physical (e.g. rheological), sensory and microbiological composition of food and beverages during development and manufacture, including changes to these properties as a consequence of process optimization. Other studies may look at the association between variables that require analysis of data to aid interpretation and presentation of the results. Appropriate statistical methods need to be used to assess and make inferences about the factors that influence the responses; for example: evaluation of the effect of adding increasing concentrations of a fruit extract on the acidity and sensory acceptance of a product; or the assessment of the effects on the biochemical markers (inflammation, oxidative stress, etc.) in experimental animals treated with different doses of a food extract or ingredient. In this sense, the use of statistical tools in food research and development is important both in academia and in industrial research in the food, chemical, and biotechnological industries. However, experience shows that many workers frequently select the wrong tests, or use the correct tests in wrong situations. For instance, many researchers often fail to pay attention to important concepts prior to comparing mean values. This may arise for one or more of the following reasons: a lack of interest in performing calculations, misinterpretation of statistical results or misuse of statistical software, among others. The rapid increase in computing power has had an important impact on the practice and application of statistics. Today, many software packages are available that facilitate statistical analysis of data; when used properly they provide a valuable tool to enable different types of statistical and mathematical analyses to be done rapidly. Such software packages take seconds to generate linear/non-linear models, draw graphs or resolve complex numerical algorithms that used to take a considerable amount of time using manual procedures. The importance of proper application of statistics in Food Research cannot be ignored; it is essential if one is to understand data and make decisions that take account of the statistical variability of measurement and process control systems, summarize experimental results, etc. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to explain some concepts regarding data analysis in Food Science and Technology; 2) to provide some statistical information and 3) to discuss and present some published examples of mathematical modeling..",
    "Critical infrastructure such as CCTV security networks, the electric grid, water networks and transportation systems operate using industrial control systems (ICS). Increasingly, as cities move to become “smart cities”, ICS are networked together for ease of use and expense reduction. ICS devices and their associated sensors are interconnected via a network that now comprises the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The IIoT is a component of what Cisco originally coined as the Internet of Everything (IoE) which describes IIoT devices used for the purposes of smart cities [10]. While IIoT provides convenience, it comes at an associated cost. ICS that make up the IIoT is constantly subject to cyberattack. Kaspersky Labs, a leading cybersecurity research and antivirus company, found that in 2016 one in every five ICS are attacked each month [15]. Further, not all of these attacks used the internet to penetrate the IIoT. Others used vectors including removable media [15]. Public administrators need to understand cyber threats. This is abundantly apparent from the recent attacks against state and city infrastructure such as the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) ransomware attack in February 2018 that disabled CDOT processes for days [7] and the SamSam ransomware attack that brought city services in Atlanta to a halt in March 2018 [2]. However, given the number of critical infrastructure components in any municipality, and the vast variety of configurations involved, it would be too time consuming to enumerate every attack pathway adversaries might take. To date, local government administrators have not been active participants in conversations on cybersecurity and have prioritized this matter [17]. Perhaps one reason for this is that public administrators have an inadequate understanding of their digital asset’s risk profile [35]. The traditional approach to enumerating attack vectors and understanding technical digital risk involves creating attack trees (also called attack graphs). Developing an attack tree for each critical infrastructure would be tedious and require highly technical knowledge as well as associated knowledge about mechanisms that might be used to attack each system. A public administrator or his/her team is not likely to have the necessary expertise to do this. This leaves cities fully exposed."
